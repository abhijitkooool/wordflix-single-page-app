Description: GraphQL Pagination - In this step we add pagination to our MoviesPage by adjusting our Apollo connection to
handle loading more entries. We fetch more entries using WPGraphQL's cursor pagination, and we store the cursor in
Apollo and use the cursor to fetch more entries when our Load More button is clicked, then we merge the new
entries with the existing entries.
