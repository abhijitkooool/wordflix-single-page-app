Description: Customize the GraphQL Schema - In this step, we customize the GraphQL schema by adding a "releaseDate" field
to the "post" type, which resolves as a custom postmeta value. We also add the field to our query on our MoviePage and
output the field in our component, replacing our "TBA" placeholder text.
